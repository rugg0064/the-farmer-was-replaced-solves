Ideas for sunflower
First obviously you just plant everywhere.
Need to harvest in order of highest value
So record the locations and orders. Once everything is panet, mass harvest in order. Once empty, replant
I don't think we want to replant while harvesting beacuse if you get a big number then you have to wait for it to grow.

The order of harvest could be a TSP problem
Supposedly has some good estimation algorithms. Will research.

Jumping ahead to multi drone. I think each drone can take a subsection to plant. Record it's entries. Then kill self and parent can merge. Then 
No--- Each child can generate their TSP path first. Then kill self to return it.
In order to make sure every drone harvests their maximums. We need some drones to wait extra long to continue to harvest.
So we will build a big scheduling algorithms

For replanting we just need to do a basic loop. The larger the map is the less it matters that you go over the last 10


Data - 
Drone
A - 15 15 15 14
B - 15 14 14 14
C - 14 14 13 13
D - 12 12 12 12
As we can see, Drone D only has 12's. So it needs to harvest last
And drone A has the most 15s at 3x15, so it will need to harvest 3 times
So we can build a schedule for harvesting

Table of which tile to harvest
Which level to harvest
    15    14    13  12
idx of tile to harvest
A | 1 2 3 4
B | 1     2 3 4
C |       1 2   4 5
D |                 1 2 3 4
Better than this is to abuse the little shared data we have. Resource counts.
You can plant carrots to reduce the number. This can be used to find consensus to go to next number.
One more solution could be to use statistics and assume everyone else has a certain amount of each. I wonder how this would perform

Technically it's Hamiltonian path problem not Traveling salesman problem beacuse we dont need to return to the same spot
